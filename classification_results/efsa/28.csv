Poland is bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania to the east; and the Baltic Sea and Kaliningrad Oblast, a Russian exclave, to the north. The administrative division of Poland since 1999 has been based on three levels of subdivision. The territory of Poland is divided into voivodeships (provinces); these are further divided into powiats (counties), and these in turn are divided into gminas (communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both gmina and powiat. Poland currently has 16 voivodeships, 379 powiats (including 65 cities with powiat status), and 2,478 gminas.']","['poland']","['Polen {language: German}', 'Republic of Poland', 'Rzeczpospolita Polska', 'Rzeczpospolita Polska {language: German}']","['LanguaL curation note: US FDA 1995 Code:  PL']","['Poland']","","","","","","","","","['Poland']",1,3,39.18044437703508,39.180141939791945,54.47564504452688,""
