Its form varies considerably in different species, and is largely determined by the shape and arrangement of the surrounding organs. Nonetheless, in most species it is divided into right and left lobes; exceptions to this general rule include snakes, where the shape of the body necessitates a simple cigar-like form. The internal structure of the liver is broadly similar in all vertebrates.', 'An organ sometimes referred to as a liver is found associated with the digestive tract of the primitive chordate Amphioxus. However, this is an enzyme secreting gland, not a metabolic organ, and it is unclear how truly homologous it is to the vertebrate liver. The zebrafish liver differs from the mammalian liver in that the hepatocytes are not clearly organized in cords or lobules and the typical portal triads are not apparent. In addition, the zebrafish liver does not have Kuppfer cells. Furthermore, a clear distinction can be made between the male and female liver in the adult zebrafish. The female hepatocytes are very basophilic (Figure 15c) as a result of the production of vitellogenin (Van der Ven et al. 2003).']","[""Only ZFA considers this part_of immune system - we weaken this to an overlaps relation, as in general it's only a subset of cells that have clear immune function.""]","['All vertebrates possess a liver (reference 1); Later in craniate evolution, an anterior gill arch was transformed into jaws, and many new types of feeding subsequently evolved.(...)
